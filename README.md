# Wild-Living
A mod to bring a little more life and variety to the wilds of Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead.

Intended for 'InnaWoods' playthroughs, this mod adds a lot of content centered around living in the woods and swamps without access to modern technology. Where possible, historical methods are provided for various things that currently require modern tools.

## Features

Overview:
- Expanded Clay usages and glazing
- Passive collection of time consuming materials
- Expanded foraging
- New uses for trees (Saps, Barks, Leaves)
- Low-tech tools that don't require a full smithing setup
- More things to ferment and pickle

## Terrain/Resources

### Bog Iron
Provides a source of iron/steel for wilderness run, prospect salt water swamp tiles for a chance to find a small amount of bog iron. Smelt bog iron into iron ingots for direct use, combine with charcoal to create low quality but usable steel.

### Iron Ingot
The result of smelting bog iron to a usable state, iron ingots are used directly by some recipes and can be converted into scrap iron.

### Steel Ingot
The result of a little metallurgy know-how, some charcoal and iron, steel. The steel isn't the greatest quality but can be used directly in some recipes and convert into steel lumps.

### Pine Sap
Can be harvested with a tree spile from Pine trees, provides an early alternative to bone glues for simple adhesive tasks like arrow head and fletching attachment.

### Birch Sap
Similar to Maple Sap, birch sap can be harvested at the start of spring and drank directly as a sweetened clean water, processed into birch syrup or fermented into Birch Beer

### Holly Leaves
Found occasionally while foraging, these stiff leaves from a holly bush make a passable early game fletching material.

### Wicker
Willow Trees can also be harvested in summer for wicker, after preparation and drying, wicker can be used to create rattan items and furniture.

### Small Pelts
Small creatures with pelts (Rabbits, Squirrels, etc) may be skinned with a skinning knife to produce Small Pelt, which can be turned into usable furs quickly with a saltless method of tanning that requires one egg per small pelt. Four small tanned pelts can be stitched together into a Tanned Fur Pelt with a little bit of cordage, perfect for that first fur coat.

## Constructables

### Moisture Traps
Provides a way to passively generate water overnight. One digs a pit, places a collection vessel in the pit then covers the top with a large amount of foliage. Water dew forms on the foliage and collects in the vessel. The water will still require boiling to be drinkable.

### Salt Extractor
Essentially a specialised camp fire, the salt extractor uses a clay salt pot placed over the fire, the water boils off and leaves salt behind. Can be left unattended with occasional refilling to produce a steady supply of salt.

### Evaporative Salt Extractor
A much larger version of the salt extractor that works on solar evaporation, so best used in summer. It consists of a large 30L shallow bowl placed and filled with salt water, the water is allowed to evaporate in the sun over a period of a few hours or days, depending on the weather, the result is a large amount of salt.

### Wooden Work Mat
When butchering, you really want a flat surface to work on, this simple wooden workmat is a rolled up collection of long sticks bound together with cordage, create a flat draining surface you can wipe clean after use.

## Wicker
With the addition of Willow Wicker, new furniture items are available using a combination of wicker and wood.

### Wicker/Wooden Furniture

#### Wicker Fence
A woven wicker fence, won't stop a determined zombie (or moose) but provides a barrier for small animals and marking out of areas.

### Wicker Items

#### Wicker Basket
A lovely woven asket to store a few litres worth of storage in when wandering the wilds.

### Tools

#### Skinning Knife
A small knife made from knapped flint used specifically for skinning small animals quickly in the field.

#### Flint Drill
A very simple tree tapping drill that uses a struck peice of flint to create a small auger blade on a crank. Hand powered and quite fragile. Useful for tapping maple and pine trees for sap or pitch.

### More Clay Items
Additional clay containers and items to give clay a little more use in the world.

#### Clay Glazes
Clay items that are to hold water or liquids require glazing, the simplest and most common form of glaze material is wood ash collected from a fire pit. Unglazed pottery isn't waterproof.

#### Glazed Clay Salt Pot
A wide shallow pot that holds 5L of liquid, intended for use with the Salt Extractor.

#### Glazed Clay Pickling Jar
A 5L clay jar designed for use in pickling vegetables and other foods. An airlock is provided by the use of a water channel between the body and the lid, a small amount of water is used to fill the channel then the lid is placed to begin fermenting.
